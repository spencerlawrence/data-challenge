## create.sql
Here are the create database and table statements for the dermstore schema

## create.mov
I took a screen recording showing how I made the create statements in 1.5 minutes using multicursor (Sublime Text).
Text editing is a funny skill I have that's hard to show off, so I couldn't resist.

## select.sql
This file contains three interesting select statements.

## insert.py
I chose python to insert the 5 rows of random data.
The python script uses a [random name generator library](https://pypi.org/project/names/) and [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).
